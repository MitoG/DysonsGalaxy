Dysons Galaxy brings some more customization to the galaxy
creation.

Don't like the distance stars have between them ?
Change it!
Don't like that you NEED 32 stars but can only HAVE 64 ?
Change it!

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

V1.0 Main Release:
Able to change the arbitrary limit of minimum 32 stars and
maximum 64 stars.
Able to change the minimum distance stars have to have
between them.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
At the moment the game has to be restarted when you make a
change to the settings via the SHIFT+F10 UMF Menu.

When changing the Star count settings you have to restart it
before changes take effect.

When changing the distance setting the changes take effect
immediatly. So you can start a game but have to manually save
and restart the game then for auto-saving to be enabled again.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
